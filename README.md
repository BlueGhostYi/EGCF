# EGCF
This is the PyTorch implementation for our TOIS 2024 paper:

## Environment
```
python == 3.8.18
pytorch == 2.1.0 (cuda:12.1)
scipy == 1.10.1
numpy == 1.24.3
```

## Examples to run the codes
We adopt three widely used large-scale recommendation datasets: Yelp2018, Amazon-Book, and Alibaba-iFashion. EGCF is an easy-to-use recommendation model in which the most important hyperparameters are the weight of the contrastive loss `ssl_lambda` and temperature coefficient `temperature`.

Steps to run the code:
1. In the folder . /configure to configure the EGCF.txt file
2. Set the EGCF according to the following optimal parameters:

- Yelp2018:
```
dataset = yelp2018
ssl_lambda = 0.1
temperature = 0.1
mode = parallel
```
- Amazon-Book:
```
dataset = amazon-book
ssl_lambda = 0.3
temperature = 0.1
mode = parallel
```
- Alibaba-iFashion:
```
dataset = iFashion
ssl_lambda = 0.05
temperature = 0.2
mode = alternate
```

*The log folder provides training logs for reference. The results of a single experiment may differ slightly from those given in the paper because they were run several times and averaged in the experiment.

3. Run main.py.

*EGCF is now also integrated into the graph recommendation library [ID-GRec](https://github.com/BlueGhostYi/ID-GRec).
